# awesome-ethmergedata


*A list of resources for tracking Ethereum data dashboards and tools for monitoring. We take no responsibility for the accuracy of the data published. Be aware of different biases and definitions used across dashboards.*

## Intro

With the Merge going through successfully, Ethereum has changed permanently. If you are not familiar with the details, [hereâ€™s a good primer](https://coinmetrics.io/special-insights/ethereum-merge/). The new process for adding transactions to the chain has significant trade-offs with respect to [economics](http://ultrasound.money), [energy usage](https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/), [MEV](https://github.com/flashbots/eth2-research), [censorship](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance)-[resistance](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost/issues/215), security and [centralization](https://noxx.substack.com/p/order-flows-kingmaker-of-the-block).

The data is crucial to monitor, track and interpret progress of these dimensions. This post intends to provide a coherent library of twitter accounts, dashboards, data tools and other lists. We will do our best to keep it up to date, although this space moves very quickly.

If you have feedback, additions or questions, please make a pull request! Feel free to [ping me](twitter.com/mountbranch) on twitter if I'm not fast enough to approve. All help to keep this up-to-date is appreciated.

## Glossary

### Types

There are five types of resources:

1. **Twitter accounts** to follow to understand the space (excl. accounts of the dashboards), e.g., [@blink_labs_xyz](twitter.com/blink_labs_xyz) 
2. **Dashboards** of live data, e.g., [ultrasound.money](http://ultrasound.money) 
3. **Repos** of tools you can use to extract data yourself
4. **Meta-lists** which are lists in themselves
5. **Raw-data** which are API's or published raw data

### Coverage

The resources cover different categories of data. For ease of use, the resources are classified according to what they are focused on.

**Blocks**: blocks built, proposed and finalized

**Builder**: proposes blocks to validators, through relays

**Burn**: Eth reduction of supply through fee burn due to EIP-1559

**MEV**: Maximal extractable value

**MEV-Boost**: Intermediate design towards full PBS, proposed by Flashbots

**Validator**: Consensus participant 

**Relay**: Relays blocks from builders to validators

**Rewards**: Eth earned of different participants

**Supply**: Amount of eth in circulation and staked
